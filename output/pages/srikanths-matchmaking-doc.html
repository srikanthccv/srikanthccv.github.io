    <p>The pressure of getting married and "settle down" starts to grow as you near mid 20s. I have been delaying it citing different reasons but they were lame excuse as I want to focus more on career goals. I was asked to share a "bio-data" with bunch of details which I think are useless so I decided to write a page on this tiny website of myself, what drives me and what do i derive meaning and happiness from.</p>
<p>I have only three things I want to dedicate my time to 1. family 2. work 3. sport. Work takes up at least 1/3rd of adult life and I strongly believe that everyone should find something that they really enjoy working on and spend their career crafting the skill and building something usefull and meaningful. Physical sports is something i really want to invest time into as it clears my mind after long time of work and keeps me healthy. Family, I want to build a tiny family of my own and raise kids and grow older together with someone.</p>
<h2>Pros</h2>
<ol>
<li>I am a very driven person and obsessively invest time into anything that resonates or aligns with what I care about.</li>
<li>I am willing to take the primary responsibility of raising kids or managing house if it means my partner realising her dreams that require taking risks. And equally I would want a partner to be support system for me realise potentially risky endeavour if it requires a trade-off.</li>
<li>I'm excited about fatherhood and committed to being an equal parent.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Cons</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I don't know if it's the social anxiety or the introversion, but I don't like (large) social gatherings or meeting people in genral outside very close friends and family circle. This starts (verbal) fight some times because my family insists on me to go out and meet "relatives" or interact with society against my will and I don't like doing something for sake of pleasing others, so the whole discussion eventually ends in leaving everyone upset. This makes me uncompatible with people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I work, a lot. I really do. I spend great deel of my time improving myself and building. Casual leisure just... doesn't fit into the equation. This doesn't mean I don't have time for family. I am going to quote the great Leo Rosten here.

</ol>
<h2>On Kids</h2>
<p>I want to have biological kids of my own and I am looking for someone who is also excited to have kids some day. I am flexible on when to have kids depending on our mutual goals. Kids bring meaning to life. I like playing, doing goofy and childish things with them. I made a friends with two who kind of treat me like their own brother from the staying in PG days. Here is picture of them on my cycle. I would love to introduce them to you and play with them.</p>

<p>Movies rarely stay with me the way "భీమిలి కబడ్డీ జట్టు" did. I must have been in 9th or 10th class, watching it on TV, and by the end I was sobbing. For days afterward, I felt... haunted isn't quite right, but the movie had carved out a space inside me and wouldn't leave. I couldn't focus on anything else; it was like walking around in a different world. I don't watch the movie again, not because it will make me cry but I fear there won't be that haunting experience when movie ends. I don't want to ruin that. Some things should remain untouched/unchanged.</p>
