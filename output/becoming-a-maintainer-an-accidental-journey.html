<p>Microservices were a zero-interest rate phenomenon. It was a plan by Google with the help of the US gov and FED to push Kubernetes - I am joking (or <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/current-activity/2021/08/02/cisa-and-nsa-release-kubernetes-hardening-guidance">am I</a>?). This was the time when it was controversial not to do microservices. Every team had a few engineers who would passionately advocate for moving to this new cool architectural pattern in the town that solves all of your problems, technical or otherwise. I worked at a place that had followed the trend and created a un(necessarily?) complicated system. The debugging was a nightmare. The search for missing astra in my quiver as I decided to ride into the battle of the k8shetra led me to OpenTelemetry.</p>
<h2>Roll over the sand</h2>
<p>The sad reality of the project under active development is that the examples are often broken. With every release, a bunch of new errors are thrown at you mercilessly. The silent errors make you question your sanity and life choices. OpenTelemetry was no different. Given the pain I had to go through, I decided to send a pull request fixing the example, like a humble squirrel wet its body and <a href="https://archive.org/details/RanganathaRamayanamu/page/n321/mode/2up?view=theater">roll over the sand</a> over the bridge, while the monkeys pushed the big rocks to build the setu. Every small contribution counts. </p>
<h2>Show up and do stuff</h2>
<p>To escape the monotony and misery of the world around me caused by the sudden lockdown from the pandemic, I tried to pick up new hobbies to kill time and keep myself busy. After many failed attempts, I settled with some cycling and some blue screen. Over the next couple of months, I did many things. I updated the outdated docs, fixed the bugs, triaging, and answering questions on Slack and Stackoverflow. I took on each one that came my way because I was really "vibing" with the project. This phase is showing up consistently and doing stuff. </p>
