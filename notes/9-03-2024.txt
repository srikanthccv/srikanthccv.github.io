What happens when `INSERT INTO` ClickHouse. I am specifically interested in navigating the code base and finding the call stack

- The request arrives at TCPHandler
- `executeQuery` is called with the query
- `executeQuery` calls `executeQueryImpl`
- `executeQueryImpl` calls interpreter factor function to get the relevant interpreter
- `InterpreterInsertQuery::execute` get called
- which in turn calls `buildPreSinkChain`
- `ExpressionActions` and `Block::insert` get called
- The block is returned
- The ast and io block is returned all the way back to `TCPHandler`
- The `processInsertQuery` get called in the `TCPHandler`
- This calls the executor with number of threads
- The executor is responsinble for writing to disk?
