Title: Srikanth's dating doc

The number of times you get asked about getting married and "settling down" starts to grow as you near the end of your mid-20s. I have been delaying it by citing different reasons, but they were lame excuses as I wanted to focus more on my career goals. Now, I think I am emotionally and financially ready, so I decided to write a page on this tiny website of mine instead, because it's fun and I can give a peek into how I think and what I value.

The three things I want to dedicate my time to are: 1. family 2. work 3. sport. Of course, family is always the number one priority. What is this life and wealth for if not for cherished moments with loved ones and taking care of them? Work takes up at least 1/3 of adult life, and I strongly believe that everyone should find something they are really passionate about and spend their career crafting that skill and building something great and useful.

## Pros

1. I am a very driven person and obsessively invest time into anything that resonates or aligns with what I care about.
2. I am willing to take the primary responsibility of raising kids or managing the house if it means my partner realizing her dreams that require taking risks. And equally, I would want a partner to be a support system for me to realize potentially risky endeavors if that happens.
3. I'm excited about fatherhood and committed to being an equal parent.

## Cons

1. I don't know if it's the social anxiety or the introversion, but I don't like (large) social gatherings or meeting people in general outside my very close friends and family circle. This occasionally starts verbal fights sometimes because my family insists that I go out and meet "relatives" or interact with society against my will, and I don't like doing something for the sake of pleasing others, so the whole discussion eventually ends with everyone upset.

2. I work a lot. I really do. I spend a great deal of my time improving myself and building. Casual leisure just... doesn't fit into the equation. This doesn't mean I don't have time for family. I am going to quote the great Leo Rosten here.

3. I need significant alone time to recharge. I can go days or even a week wanting minimal human interaction unless necessary.

## On Kids

I want to have (biological) kids of my own and I am looking for someone who is also excited to have kids someday. I am flexible on when to have kids depending on our mutual goals. Kids bring meaning to life. I like playing and doing goofy and childish things with them.

## Movies

Movies rarely stay with me the way "భీమిలి కబడ్డీ జట్టు" did. I must have been in 9th or 10th class, watching it on TV, and by the end I was sobbing. For days afterward, I felt... haunted isn't quite right, but the movie had carved out a space inside me and wouldn't leave. I couldn't focus on anything else; it was like walking around in a different world. I don't want to watch the movie again, not because it will make me cry but I fear there won't be that haunting experience when movie ends. I don't want to ruin that. Some things should remain untouched/unchanged.

some of the movies I recently watched and recommend (in that order).

## Influence of family and relatives

It's exhausting and stressful to live worrying about what extended family and relatives think or will say. I want minimal to no external influence on our personal decisions. There's often too much gossip and unnecessary drama that I prefer to avoid. You know what I am taking about.

## Religion & Politics

I'm not a religious person but don't mind religious activities if they bring joy. I would be happy to go to temple with family or to church and offer prayer with those two kids ^ if they ask me to join (they practice Christianity).

I'm not associated with any political party, but I take voting seriously and believe it is a moral duty to cast a vote.
