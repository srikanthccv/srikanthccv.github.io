Title: About

This is my personal website. I write about things that interest me. I am a software engineer by profession. I am interested in developer tools, observability, and databases and systems in general. I currently work at [SigNoz](signoz.io). I am also a maintainer of [OpenTelemetry](https://github.com/open-telemetry). In the past I worked at a consultancy, startup that went out of business and [Darwinbox](https://darwinbox.com).
