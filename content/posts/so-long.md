I had the most fun working on the project. Thanks for everything. This was the longest I worked on in a single project (yet). It changed me in ways I can't put into words especially the social dynamics of our collaboration that I won't be able to replicate. Thanks Leighton, Owais, Aaron, Deigo, Alex, and everyone else who helped me.
